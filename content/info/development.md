## Architecture/Engineering

- [The Platform Engineer](https://engineering.razorpay.com/the-platform-engineer-db2b21434911)
- Example Applications
  - [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) - The ultimate demo app, with multiple frontend and backend frameworks
  - [Google's Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) - True Microservice e-commerce app, written as a pologot style service covering most modern development languages today (Node, Go, Python, C#, Java)
  - [Google's Bank of Anthos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos) - A lighter microservice example app - only Python and Java.  Both referencing PostgreSQL databases for persistence.
  - [WeaveWorks' Sock Shop](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) - Another example Microservice app.  Leverages Spring Boot, Go, and Node.js.  Also leverages RabbitMQ.

## Docker

- [Docker Anti-Patterns](https://codefresh.io/containers/docker-anti-patterns/)
- [GUI Apps In Docker](https://www.trickster.dev/post/running-gui-apps-within-docker-containers/)

## Security

- [Reproductable Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

## Tools

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/):  All configurations should be in a version management system, and git is probably the best available.  For any open source code [Github](https://github.com/) is pretty much the defacto host for a lot of projects.
- [JQPlay](https://jqplay.org/): Quick way to debug jq filters.  [Also available as a Docker image](https://github.com/munntjlx/jqplay)
- Makefile: Explained in [Makefiles for Modern Development](https://dzone.com/articles/makefiles-for-modern-development)
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/): Tool for rapid rebuild/live build environments.

## Articles/Books

- [A Dev's Thoughts On Developer Productivity](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/developer-productivity-thoughts): A great discussion on optimizing the "inner" developer loop.
- [Art of Unix Programming](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/)
- [ChgLog](https://github.com/goreleaser/chglog) implementing [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
- [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/): A pretty standard process for committing to many open-source projects.
- [Uncurled](https://un.curl.dev/) ([Source](https://github.com/bagder/uncurled)): From the author of curl,  "everything I know and learned about running and maintaining Open Source projects for three decades."
- [The Command Line in 2004](http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/commandline/index.html)
- [yagni - You Aren't Gonna Need It](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html): Could also easily apply to IaC code-bases
