title: "Chromebook Experiment"
---

Due to the alignment of some stars financially, I went out and obtained a Chromebook for practically free!  Specifically I am getting a [Toshiba Chromebook 2](http://www.toshiba.com/us/computers/laptops/chromebook/cb30/CB35-B3340).  Although I tend to lean more toward open source OSes and non-cloud services, I want to explore the feasibility of actually using a lightweight laptop for regular purposes.  Specifically I will be focusing around three use cases:

  * Normal End User Tasks.  
  * Sysadmin Tasks.
  * Development Tasks.


A primary motivation is to gain enough information and experience that I am comfortable suggesting a Chromebook for appropriate use cases.  A recommendation has more weight if one has actually used the device and knows it's benefits and drawbacks.
