title: "PaperCSS, A More Human Interface"
---
Browsing the Internet at random, I came across a [great Hugo theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/papercss-hugo-theme) based
on [PaperCSS](https://www.getpapercss.com/).  The human feel of the typeface and layout really pulled me in.  My desire is 
to make my blog approachable.  So I begin with the theme, but overall will aim to make sure my content itself is modest.
