## Upgrade

Upgrade was near flawless.  As I didn't want to wait, I [downloaded the Windows 11 Installer to perform the upgrade manually](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).  The wizard did have me remove Virtualbox, but as I don't hardly use straight VMs, a small sacrafic.  

## X-Windows

The biggest driver for me was native X-Windows support!  While VcXsrv works, it's hardly an ideal experience.  Manually setting display variables, opening windows firewall ports, and leaving the Xserver a bit more promiscuous then I prefer.  The upgrade left my WSL2 environment working perfectly (besides having to reenable Docker for Desktop WSL2 integration in that environment - just a checkbox).  A quick DuckDuckGo search revealed [the instructions for exisitng WSL installs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps#existing-wsl-install).  A quick `wsl --update` and `wsl --shutdown` from an elevated Powershell was all it took.
