Another vulnerability on the heels of [Lenovo's Superfish](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/superfish), there is a somewhat serious issue with Dell's System Detect Utility reported by 
[F-Secure](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002800.html) (via [Fierce IT Security](http://www.fierceitsecurity.com/story/hackers-still-able-seize-control-dell-computers-using-faulty-diagnostic-too/2015-04-07?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal)).  At least this wasn't specifically a Malware-like application, but still makes one pause about the amount of pre-installed software on modern Windows PCs, and the difficulty of doing a clean OS install.
