An overall discussion of mobile coding.

## General Strategies

The best approach is to offload most of your development enviornment into the Cloud (a Cloud Development Environment, or CDE).  From there you can provision whatever resources and archetecture that you need.  From there, we need to look at our interface to that CDE from the phone

### CDE Options

- Preferred: Coder.com
- Alternative: Github Codespaces

### Interface

- VScode/Code server web interface
  - Android: Hacker keyboard
  - BUT...for iphone, will need bluetooth keyboard to access function, ctrl, etc
