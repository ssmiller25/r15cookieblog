With the impending birth of our son, I revisited my original [Android GitOps Workflow post]({{ ref "2020-05-31-androidgitopswriting.md" }}).  We will be in the hospital for
an extended period of time.  I'll have my Chromebook, but it's conceivable that I'll wish to update my blog and personal notes from the phone.
Both my personal journal and bullet/Monk Manual journal are both in git repositories,.  In 2021, my stack is far more simple:

- **Logitech K480 Bluetooth Keyboard** - Not a requirement, but very handy for large amounts of text input.
- **Github Android App** - A very nice app, espcially for obtaining repositories URLs and tokens
- **Spck Editor** - Excellent IDE with direct support for Github and Gitlab repos.
