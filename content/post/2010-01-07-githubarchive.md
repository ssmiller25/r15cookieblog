Want to preserve your writing and code for future generations? Then check out the Github Archive Program at [https://archiveprogram.github.com/](https://archiveprogram.github.com/). Github will archive all active public Github repos for storage in the arctic that is estimated to last 1,000 years. It's a cool way to preserve the technology and culture around open source,and also a great way for you to be able to save your content off for the far future. 

If you are already a Github user, you are 90% of the way there! Just make sure all repos that you want saved are public, and that you have sent a commit to your HEAD branch (usually master) within the past few months. Just for safety, I'd recommend at least committing some update this month, even if it's just to your README. 

If you are not a Github user, or not technically inclined, you can still participate. First, go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and click the "Sign Up" button. It's free and all you need is an email address. Once you have signed up, go to [https://guides.github.com/features/pages/](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to learn how to make a free webpage using Github. Since this page is publicly accessible by default, you'll have content that will be put into the arctic vault! 

Github has provided an amazing chance for us to help retain information for the future. It's a great opportunity to participate in preserving history and culture.
