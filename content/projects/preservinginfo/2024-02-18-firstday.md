First day of my 100 day project to perserve information!  Most of today was spent building out this project page!  In effect this post itself is a representation of what I wish to accomplish - storing data in a format that is accessible for future.  In that regard, the raw data is in ASCII format - probably the most readable text format, at a base level.  

My primary "base" formats will be ASCII for text, and JPEG for images.  On top of those standards, my plan is to build tools that will save this information (and metadata), access it easily, and be able to manipulate it in the future.

Most of today was spent - on the project page itself!  Although lined up with the project, as this is all recorded as ASCII text, with Markdown that allows for some formatting, but readable easy on any system that can read ASCII text.
