## Getting Started

Starting with a new 3D printer can be exciting, but also scary! Here are some incredibly helpful links.

### Fixes/Calibration

- [My prints look like this, let's fix them!](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/)
- [3D Calibration Guide](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html): Excellent guide to calibrating your printer
- [How to Calibrate Your Extruder](https://www.matterhackers.com/articles/how-to-calibrate-your-extruder): A little focused around Matter Controls, but show be helpful for most printers
- [Layer Shifting Guide](https://forums.matterhackers.com/topic/76/how-to-fix-shifting-layers)
- [Unclog a 3D Print Nozzle](https://www.matterhackers.com/news/how-to-unclog-a-3d-printer-nozzle)
- [Ultimaker Visual Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide)

### Delta Printer Guides

- [Dimensional Accuracy for Delta Printers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1439048)

### GCode

- [Forum Post to Fix STLs using Meshlab](http://www.shapeways.com/forum/index.php?t=msg&th=1704&start=0&S=8acada7d3cfec6486dac50760db28646)

## 3D Rendering

The objective is to render STL into more realistic images.  Currently focused around PovRay as a tool

## 3D Printers

- Creality
  - Ender 3: Our Main Go-To printer.  
  - CR-10:  If you need a bigger platform
- Rostock - A neat "delta" style 3D printer.

## Accessories

- [Ikea Lack 3D Print Enclosures](https://all3dp.com/2/ikea-3d-printer-enclosure-tutorial/): Really neat idea for enclosing your 3D printers using Ikea parts as a base.

## CNC

- [Interesting CNC Build using a wooden frame.](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-CNC)  Also uses Arduino to control electronics
- [Easel](http://www.easel.com): Interested web-based CAD/CAM for 2.5D modelling.  Easy to use, and integrated into GRBL based controllers so that you can Mill directly from the web interface.
