## Stacks

- Workstation
  - Primary Personal Laptop: Macbook Air M2 2022, 8GB RAM.  Not a powerful machine, but I can run in the cloud...
  - Secondary Laptop: Asus Chromebook.  By both allowing Android apps and having a Linux layer that can be enabled, which works with both X apps and docker, it's a pretty serviceable workstation.  Especially bring a laptop into situations where the laptop could potentially be stolen - far less expensive to replace, and automatically encrypted. 
  - All of these comfigured with a combo of [wksetup](https://github.com/ssmiller25/wksetup) for initial setup.
- Private Infrastructure
  - TBD: Eventually a small-ish k3s cluster on x86 SBCs.
- Public Infrastructure
  - [www.r15cookie.com](https://www.gitlab.com/ssmiller25/r15cookieblog) - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at the moment.  Fully containerize and can be moved to another provider if necessary
  - Email to r15cookie.com - Google Gsuite - Grandfathered into the Gsuite free tier when it existed.
  - app.r15cookie.com - Digital Ocean "sketchpad" VM.  Will eventually be decommissioned for some native k8s env with the ability to spin up resources on demand.
 - Public k8s cluster implementation.  Work in progress.
