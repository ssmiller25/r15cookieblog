I'm still compiling my large list of tasks, and hope to break them out blog posts/wiki documents.  But the coolest thing I've come across so far is that the Chromebook can  open up Rar files!  Rar compressed files are not too common, but nice to know it's one less item I'll have to depend on another machine to perform.
