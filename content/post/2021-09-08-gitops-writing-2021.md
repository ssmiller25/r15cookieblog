title: "Android GitOps 2021"

With the impending birth of our sone, revisiting my original [Android GitOps Workflow](2021-05-31-androidgitopswriting.md).  We will be in the hopital for 
an extended period of time.  I'll have my Chromebook, but it's still conceivable that I'll wish to update my blog and personal notes from the phone. 
As my personal journal and Bullet/Monk Manual Journal are both in git repositories, this seems ideal.  In 2021, my stack is far more simple:

- **Logitech K480 Bluetooth Keyboard** - Not a requirement, but very handy for large amounts of text input.
- **Github Android App** - A very nice app, espcially for obtaining repositories URLs and tokens
- **Spck Editor** - Excellent IDE with direct support for Github and Gitlab repos.
