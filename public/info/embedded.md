# Hardware Platforms

  * [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/):  Probably THE embedded plamform at the consumer level, although can be used for production purposes.
  * [Onion Omega2](https://onion.io/Omega2/):  A great product if you need an "Arduino" like device but with the power of Linux and wifi connectivity.  At a base price of $9, really hard to beat!
  * [Soekris](http://soekris.com/): Looks like a good selection of embedded x86 compatible hardware.  Recommended by a consultant years ago.
  * [RouterBoard](http://routerboard.com): Provider hardware for MikroTik RouterOS, but could potentially install Linux
