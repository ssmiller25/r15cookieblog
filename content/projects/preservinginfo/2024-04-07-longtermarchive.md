Recipe archiving is continuing slowely.  Now that the holiday is over, and before my next big adventure for are yearly work gathering, I'd like to continue a more holistic view of my data archive.  Items I'd like to archive

- My "journal" in markdown format - daily thoughts, etc.
- My "bullet journal" in markdown format - daily tasks, zettlekrasten, etc.
- recipe - personal recipe.
- photos - JPEG formatted photos.

As part of this I"ve sketched out a new repo - private for now - that will contain code to replicate the markdown repos, as well as organize, format, and archive the photos.  If I make good enough progress, I will open up the repo for use by anyone.  The repo itself is build out as a devcontainer, code spaces compatible, so to promote the ability to work on this project from any location.
