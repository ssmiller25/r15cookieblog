Recently have discovered a diverse community of individuals rejecting the current Web2 (social media) and Web3 (Blockchain/NFT/metaverse/whatever else is bucketed in Web3) and back to the non-commercial, unique roots of the Internet that existed before the widespread centralization of the Internet.  A time when site's goals were not to get you addicted to the dopamine hits of likes and aggravation, but to simply express the creativity and interest of their creators.

## May Web 0 Projects

- [Approximate Pi Day](https://approximatepiday.com/) - A celebration of July 22nd as approximate Pi day (22/7 ≈ 3.1428 ≈ 3.14159).  The site is also an exploration of using modern DevOps/JAMStack technologies to host a Web0 site.
- [This Blog](https://r15cookie.com) - Click the fox in the corner to see the soruce code that drives this site.  Kind of accidentally Web0.
