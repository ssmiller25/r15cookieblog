Although raw ASCII text is my plan for data preservation, most people would like to view/browse information.  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the static site generator I use for my public site.  I've had a desire to keep family recipe, and coffee reviews, publically available.  With that smaller goal in mind, I [updated my hugo template](https://github.com/ssmiller25/r15-papercss-hugo-theme/pull/1) to include recipe and coffee subtypes, as a first step.

I should say _mine_ with an astrisk that my template is a copy of the original [PaperCSS Hugo Template](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/papercss-hugo-theme) but was archived last year.  

Tomorrow I may work on building a demo site for the template.  I still need to reconcile the proper handing of public and private data within the overarching goals of this preserving information project.
