Vagrant is one of the most useful tools for automating the build of Virtual environments for testing and development purposes. I&amp;rsquo;m usually a Linux/Unix type guy, but on occasion it would be nice to be able to test Windows.
I just came across this post that indicates the modern.ie has provided a set of base boxes that are usable for Vagrant. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to test them yet, but plan to do so soon.</description>
