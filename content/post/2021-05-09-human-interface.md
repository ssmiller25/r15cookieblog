title: "PaperCSS, A More Human Interface"

DevOps, at it's core, is really about increasing the communcation between people and groups.  In 
that spirit, and because my old theme felt dated, that I decided to move to [PaperCSS](https://www.getpapercss.com/).
There is a [great Hugo theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/papercss-hugo-theme).  I've made some modest adjustments,
but planning to submit them to upstream once they are cleaned up.  I enjoy the simplicity, as well as the hand-drawn
apperance.  It feels more approachable - and all of us in technology need to keep in mind the our primary goals 
should be to make lives better - either by reducing tedious tasks or allowing people to do tasks and gain insight
they would wouldn't be able to.
