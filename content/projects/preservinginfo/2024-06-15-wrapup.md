Well, wraping up WELL after the project end date of May 28th.  Personal and family events take precidence over personal project.  However, I'm still satisfied with what I have been abel to accomplish - mainly the recipe sub-site that can help archive family recipe history, and sketches for where to go from here.

As an adjacent item, I've begun to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  While Obsidian itself is not open source, it saves all the core data on local disk as Markdown, and with it's extensive plugin system and sync between multiple devices, it solves a pain-point or providing access to my main task system on the phone.  I'm still in the midst of converting my main repo over, but over the past 2 weeks of using it for daily notes, I find it very encouraging.
