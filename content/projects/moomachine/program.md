The interpreter and interface logic was written in C, using the Arduino libraries and IDE.  More information is available at http://www.arduino.cc/.  The Arduino Mega is the target platform.

Source code for the version I demonstrated is located [on Github, specifically for version 0.9](https://github.com/ssmiller25/moomachine/blob/v0.9/moomachine.ino).  The full repo is at [https://github.com/ssmiller25/moomachine/](https://github.com/ssmiller25/moomachine/)
