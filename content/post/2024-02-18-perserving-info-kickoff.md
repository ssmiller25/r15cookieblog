title: "Perserving Info Kickoff"
---
Kicking off a [100 Day Project](https://www.the100dayproject.org/) focused on buiding a system for perserving data long-term.  Daily blog will ber located in the [Perserving Info Project Space](/projects/preservinginfo/).  Overall kind of excited - and gives me a nice personal project to grind away at.  Good to get back into writing.  And this blog serves as a good basis for the project - a complete text representation existing within [My Primary](https://gitlab.com/ssmiller25/r15cookieblog) and [Secondary](https://github.com/ssmiller25/r15cookieblog) archive locations, in pure text.

Daily updates will be limited to that project page - a good way to avoid cluttering up my main blog page.
