# Go Language Resources

## Development

- [Makefiles for Golang](https://sahilm.com/makefiles-for-golang/)
- [Go For Ops](https://github.com/mhausenblas/go4ops): A bit older, but *might* be useful.
- [Errors are values](https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values): Great discussion on good error handing in Go

## Libraries

- [Script](https://github.com/bitfield/script): Framework for development shell/pipe link constructs in Go. 
Useful fro moving shell scripts/small programs over to Go.
