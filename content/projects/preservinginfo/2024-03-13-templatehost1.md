title: "r15-papercss Template Infrastrucutre Work"
---
Sickness has run it's course through the family, and unfortunately has prevented me from devoting the time I wanted to.  I was able to scoop a little bit of time this morning, and have a [functioanl terraform template](https://github.com/ssmiller25/r15-papercss-hugo-theme/pull/2) working.  The PR is not merged yet, as I need to get a working Github Action pipeline functional first.  Hopefully in the next few days.

My overall goal was to make the r15-papercss-hugo-theme easily hostable.  Once the template is complete, I'll use it as a template for my family recipe site.  I am hopeful that I can focus on providing a place for common family recipes - I find a great family tradition, perserved in a long standing format.  I'm planning to also look at ways to allow anyone, no matter their technical experience, to contribute.  Although focused on recipes, this could also be the framework for other, public and private knowledge systems.
