Bookmarklets have been interesting technology that I really wish took off a bit more.  You can add a snippet of Javascript as a browser bookmark, and have that bookmark intelligently perform actions within your browser - kind of a mini browser plugin.  Here are my favorites.  Links provided so they can be added easily in browsers that do not support direct editing - such as Safari.

- <a href="javascript:(function(){m='http://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=&su=%27+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+%27&body=%27+encodeURIComponent(document.location);w=window.open(m,%27addwindow%27,%27status=no,toolbar=no,width=575,height=545,resizable=yes%27);setTimeout(function(){w.focus();},%20250);})();">Email Page</a> - Email a link to the page via Gmail
