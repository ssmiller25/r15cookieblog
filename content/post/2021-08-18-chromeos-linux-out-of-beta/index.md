title: "ChromeOS Linux Out of Beta"
---

Linux support for ChromeOS has been great.  But the "Beta" moniker has always been a bit concerning.  [Google I/O this year claims that it was going to be out of beta soon.](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/21/linux-on-chrome-os-is-finally-out-of-beta-three-years-later/)  Although suppose to happen by may, I **just** noticed it with ChromeOS release 92 this month.  Great news alongside my [CKA accomplishment](../2021-08-15-cka/)!

I encourage anyone who is even modestly technical [to give the Linux ChromeOS experience a try](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en)  The most important item is that, unlike the rest of the ChromeOS experience, anything done on the Linux layer and it's apps are not automatically backed up.  [Google has a process for doing so manually](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9592813?hl=en&ref_topic=3415446).  You may also wish to look at more automated systems like [Restic](https://restic.net/).
