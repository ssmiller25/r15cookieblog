### Backups

- [Restic](https://restic.net/)


### Audit

- [TerraTest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/) and [Terratest, even without Terraform](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/testing-best-practices/alternative-testing-tools/)
- [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org): Perhaps start for TDD for entire stack.
