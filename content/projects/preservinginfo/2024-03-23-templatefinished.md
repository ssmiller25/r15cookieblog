The main [hugo template site](https://r15-papercss-hugo.r15cookie.com/) is finished!  Unfortunately had a **LOT** of personal sickness/other priorities the drove me away from the project. But in the sprit of finishing this, I want to at least post my recipe site!

My thoughts also turn to building out a workflow that would let me work on content or infrastructure from my mobile device.  In that way, it would be easy to use small amounts of idle time.  It feels like a good direction to take.  I imagine this will become a longer term project.  Developing a framework to allow information to last take a bit of thought and skill.  Perhaps why I see it as an art project - it hope is to get us all to think long term about the impact of our lives on others.
