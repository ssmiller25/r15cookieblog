* Operation Systems
    * CentOS: My go-to for server installations.  Being a Redhat Enterprise clone it is pretty boring, but that's a good thing for servers :-)  http://www.centos.org/
    * Ubuntu:  My go-to for desktop installations.  Being a Debian derivative makes me happy (first distro I really liked back in the 90s).  It's popularity on the desktop ensures a decent amount of support from hardware and some software vendors.  http://www.ubuntu.com/
    * VMWare:  The most popular commercial visualization platform.  What I use at my day job http://www.vmware.com
* Virtualization
    * Redhat Virtualization:  What I use at home for virtualization. Built on Linux KVM https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/#7_Virtualization
* Hosting/Business
    * NextCloud:  Sort of Google Docs/Dropbox open source replacement, self hosted.  <https://nextcloud.com/>
    * Gallery:  Web-based photo manager, with desktop photo clent.  <http://gallery.menalto.com/>
