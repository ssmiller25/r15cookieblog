Today I picked a new tagline for my site, referencing "an appreciation for simplicity".  I think one
of my main attractions to the Unix philosophy is a fundamental simplicity...which may sound strange for those that 
are just coming into Unix/Linux for the first time, and perhaps have not had a lot of exposure to the command line. By 
providing a toolbox of single purpose commands that each to their singular tasks well, an administrator can put
those together to fit the perfect solution.  As [Eric Raymond mentions in "The Unix Philosophy in One Lessons](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s07.html) Keep It Simple Stupid!

I've not always followed this philosophy myself, which is why I used "appreciation".  Simpler architectures then to be easier to 
understand and debug, and usually are far more resilient then complex architectures.  Given that, sometimes a certain
amount of complexity is required, but should only be the minimum amount of complexity required for a particular 
problem.
