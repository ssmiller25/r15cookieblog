# 3D Rendering

The objective is to render STL into more realistic images.  Currently focused around PovRay as a tool

# CNC

  * [Interesting CNC Build using a wooden frame.](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-CNC)  Also uses Arduino to control electronics
  * [Easel](http://www.easel.com): Interested web-based CAD/CAM for 2.5D modelling.  Easy to use, and integrated into GRBL based controllers so that you can Mill directly from the web interface.
