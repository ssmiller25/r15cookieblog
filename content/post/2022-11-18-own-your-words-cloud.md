title: "Own Your Words - In The Cloud"

With all the commtion surrounding twitter, came across this great article entitled [Own Your Words](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted).  Despite it's age, a great article about owning your own distribution method.  My blogging is at best inconsistent, but I find it a great personal avenue to post about topics I find interesting.  The artcile quotes Tim Bray: "Own your space on the Web, and pay for it. Extra effort, but otherwise youâ€™re a sharecropper."  

In some regards Tim is right.  But with modern technolgoeis, the "pay for it" can be incredible cheap, mostly free, and still give you the option of owning your own space.  [This Blog](https://www.r15cookie.com/) is a primary example.  The breakdown of hosting is:

- The domain itself - around $10/year.  I currently use [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) but [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) and many others offer domain registration services.
- The content of your site, kept entirely in source control and generated with a static site generator.  Both [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) are great source repositories.  Or Both!  I replicate my blog's source between both.
- Hosting.  Free options exist with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing), as well as [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

The best part of the stack above is that, as long as you control the domain, you can move your hosting anywhere.  The content is always yours, so hosting of your source control matters little, other then a place to deploy your static site.  Nothing stops you from building a bare-metal server and co-locating it, if you really wish.
