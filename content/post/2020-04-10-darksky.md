title: "Darksky..and Alternatives"

Recently [Dark Sky has announced it is being acquired by Apple](https://blog.darksky.net/). With that acquisition, the Android and Web app will be discontinued by July 2020, and the API by the end of 2021. I appreciate that they are giving some time for people to find alternatives, especially on the API side, where I know apps and sites have built heavy integrations with Dark Sky. I am disappointed that Apple is shutting down this innovative app for everyone **except** Apple customers. I enjoyed their product and was willing to pay for it. 

In search of alternatives, I remembered my wife suggested [Windy](https://www.windy.com), and I took another look. It still looks impressive! The interface is a bit busy, but for a weather geek like myself, it lets you dive into different informational layers, weather models, and historical/predictive timelines with ease. The API looks great from a technical standpoint. I wish they had more pricing tiers besides trial and premium, but at least the trial size is enough for small-time usage. Weather stations can also be added directly, which could be a great way for me to provide public information when I get my [weather station](https://www.r15cookie.com/projects/weatherstation/) running. 

I'm certainly open to alternatives, so feel free to leave a comment or send me a social media post about your favorite weather solution.
