## Draft Notes

- Nice Parts
  - Seems like less crapware overall - at least on the Lenovo side
  - WSL 2.0 Overall is nice.  
    - Built into windows...just a few optiosn 
    - FS integration via '\\wsl$\' UNC path
  - Chocolately is the secret sause for a great Linux-like experience.  Granted, I use it to automate a portion of WSL install.
- Annoying Parts
  - WSL 2.0 annoyances
    - Hybernate will cuase time to skew
    - Nested virtualization...not!
    - Would use "Dev Track" for newest features, but breaks my video on my Lenovo Thinkbook 14s.
    - X-win is a pain for mainline distros.  Yes, yes, eventuall WSLg will be a thing, but to the above, I can't run the dev builds on this particular model!
