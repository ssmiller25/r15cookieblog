## Installation - A Breeze!

Initial installation was fairly easy.  There was little documentation that came with the kit.  Nevertheless, it went fairly well.  Granted, I picked an area where I could do the install with the build-in equipment (see [Line of Site](#line-of-site) later on).  I already had an ingress point into the house for my 4G LTE setup, so I utlized the same hole.  The cable itself is a shielded RJ45 connector (CAT 7 I believe - it comes with a LONG length of cable out to the dish).

I opted to leverage my own firewall/wifi network, as most of you probably will.  There's a view caveats, which I detail in [Your Own Network](#your-own-network).  The biggest one is that the Starlink app will not work without some adjustment to your network.

## Line of Site

Make **sure** to really believe the app for line of site.  Put it out where there was some modest obstructions - trees along the northern sky.  It still worked, but would have modest interruptions every hour or two.  Video calls themselves were nearly unusable.
